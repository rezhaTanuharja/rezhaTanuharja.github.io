  This project explores various factors that may affect the life expectancy in a country.
  It reveals two interesting observations:
  <ul>
    <li>
      GDP per capita only correlates positively to life expectancy and negatively to mortality rate in wealthy countries.
    </li>
    <li>
      Countries with low GDP per capita are prone to economic inequality, leading to groups of people living in extreme poverty, leading to high mortality rate.
    </li>
  </ul>
